What is this?
-------------
node-vapix is a Node.js implementation of VAPIX®, an HTTP-based API to
interface with Axis cameras.

What is VAPIX?
--------------
> VAPIX® is Axis’ own open API (Application Programming Interface). It
> makes Axis network video solutions costefficient, flexible, scalable,
> future-proof and easy to integrate with other systems.

> All Axis network cameras and video servers have an HTTP-based
> application programming interface. VAPIX® provides functionality for
> requesting images, controlling network camera functions (PTZ, relays
> etc.) and setting/retrieving internal parameter values. The purpose
> of the API is to make it easier for developers to build applications
> that support Axis video products.
